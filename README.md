Usage

To start the application, open the link below in any modern web browser. Navigate through the application process by completing the forms and following the on-screen instructions. Be sure to enable prompts or pop-out windows in your web browser settings.
Upon opening the live link, the user is welcomed you the animated home page, giving off the space aesthetic. There is an "Apply Now" button where the user can begin their application. At the top of the website, the user can see various buttons; "Home", "Apply Now", "Contact", and "About". The "Home" button simply redirects the user back to the home page, where they were first welcomed. The "Apply Now" button acts the same as the "Apply Now" button seen in the center of the screen on the animation. This page directs you to the application page, where the user can begin entering their details and information to be later reviewed by the recruitment team. The "Contact" page, allows the user to report issues, or ask questions to the company or organization running the project. Feedback is crucial. Lastly, the "About" page, gives allows the user to learn a little about me, Ankit.

Note that the "organization" and "recruitment team" are fictional, and the website functionality is strictly front-end based.
